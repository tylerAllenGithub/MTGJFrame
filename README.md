# MTGJFrame

This is a simple Java program that uses JFrame to create a typical Magic the Gathering Life Counter. With customizable Text Fields, players take on the role of either player 1 or player 2. For those who aren't familiar with Magic the Gathering, it is a trading card game where players summon monsters and cast spells with the objective of reducing their opponent's life total to zero. I wrote this in high school to save paper.
